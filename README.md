# ðŸŽ“ Student Satisfaction Survey Analysis

This project analyzes **student feedback data** collected through a survey (Google Forms export).  
The aim is to understand **satisfaction trends**, map **ratings to sentiment categories** and generate **actionable recommendations** for improving campus events and learning experiences.



##  Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Import CSV, handle duplicates, missing values, and formatting.  
   - Generate an overview: shape, data types, metadata, and statistical summary.  

2. **Quantitative Feedback Analysis (Ratings)**  
   - Study distribution of ratings (1â€“5 scale).  
   - Compare responses across departments and courses.  

3. **Sentiment Analysis (Ratings-Based)**  
   - Map ratings to sentiment categories:  
     - Positive â†’ Ratings of 4 and 5  
     - Neutral â†’ Rating of 3  
     - Negative â†’ Ratings of 1 and 2  
   - Calculate sentiment distribution overall and by department.  

4. **Visualization of Satisfaction Trends**  
   - Bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
   - Visualize rating distribution, average scores per question, and sentiment breakdowns.  

5. **Actionable Recommendations**  
   - Highlight areas of improvement based on feedback patterns.  
   - Support decision-making for better student engagement and academic delivery.  



##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling duplicates, formatting, missing values  
- **Visualization:** Bar plots, heatmaps, pie charts, line plots  
- **Sentiment Mapping:** Ratings â†’ Sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding  



##  Key Insights
- **Most feedback is Positive** (70% of responses).  
- **Neutral responses are very low** (0.18%).  
- **Negative feedback is minimal** (0.12%).  
- Average student satisfaction score: **3.89 / 5**.  



## Visual Highlights

###  Python Visualizations
- Overall rating distribution  
- Sentiment distribution by department  
- Average score per question  
- Trends of average scores across questions  

### Power BI Dashboard
Below is a sample **dashboard** built in Power BI to present insights interactively:

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
- **Shape:** 580 rows Ã— 12 columns  
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `Questions` â†’ Survey questions  
  - `Weightage 1â€“5` â†’ Counts of ratings  
  - `Average/ Percentage` â†’ Average rating per question
